        <p>You think water moves fast? You should see ice. It moves like it has a mind. Like it knows it killed the
            world once and got a taste for murder. After the avalanche, it took us a week to climb out. Now, I don't
            know exactly when we turned on each other, but I know that seven of us survived the slide... and only five
            made it out. Now we took an oath, that I'm breaking now. We said we'd say it was the snow that killed the
            other two, but it wasn't. Nature is lethal but it doesn't hold a candle to man.</p>
        <p>My money's in that office, right? If she start giving me some bullshit about it ain't there, and we got to go
            someplace else and get it, I'm gonna shoot you in the head then and there. Then I'm gonna shoot that bitch
            in the kneecaps, find out where my goddamn money is. She gonna tell me too. Hey, look at me when I'm talking
            to you, motherfucker. You listen: we go in there, and that nigga Winston or anybody else is in there, you
            the first motherfucker to get shot. You understand?</p>

        <p>Normally, both your asses would be dead as fucking fried chicken, but you happen to pull this shit while I'm
            in a transitional period so I don't wanna kill you, I wanna help you. But I can't give you this case, it
            don't belong to me. Besides, I've already been through too much shit this morning over this case to hand it
            over to your dumb ass.</p>
        <p>Look, just because I don't be givin' no man a foot massage don't make it right for Marsellus to throw Antwone
            into a glass motherfuckin' house, fuckin' up the way the nigger talks. Motherfucker do that shit to me, he
            better paralyze my ass, 'cause I'll kill the motherfucker, know what I'm sayin'?</p>
